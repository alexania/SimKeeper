      Start your records either by:<br/><br/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Adding your first Sim:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Click the "Add Sim" button or press enter.</li>
            <li>The button will be disabled the name is less than 3 characters long.</li>
            <li>This text box doubles as search!</li>
            <li>The first Sim added will be set as the Root Sim and the family name will be set to its surname. (This can be changed afterward, don't stress.)</li>
          </ul>

        <li>
          <b>Import a GEDCom file</b>
          <ul>
            <li>You can use <a href="https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/doc/mc_gedcom" target="_blank">MCCC</a> to generate a GedCom.</li>
            <li><b>This will overwrite the current records.</b></li>
            <li>The MCCC GedCom file doesn't have a concept of dates or sequence of events, so those won't be imported.</li>
            <li>It also assumes that all parents were married at some point, so you might have to go delete some marriages.</li>
            <li>If you're using a GedCom that contains info I'm not using, send it to me and I'll look into updating the import.</li>

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>How do I know what day it is in game?</dt>
        <dd>I haven't actually found a way to do this. Since I started these records mid-game I guesstimated it based on the age spans (I use the <a href="http://modthesims.info/d/576053/show-search-sim-info-mod.html" target="_blank">Sim Info mod</a> to work out the sim's age).<br/>
          If you're starting the records off at the beginning it's easier so long as you remember to increment the day every in-game midnight. If you don't want to use the "Day" functionality, just ignore it, override the stages and use it to order events.</dd>
        <dt>Can I change the Sim portraits?</dt>
        <dd>For the moment no. Since I'm not storing any info there's no real way of uploading images.<br/>
        Two ways I can implement this is to either provide a selection of preset images to choose from, or allow you to provide a url to an image hosted somewhere else. Let me know which method you'd prefer.</dd>
        <dt>The website looks broken on a browser that isn't Chrome!</dt>
        <dd>Yeah uhhh... Look over there! They added cars to Sims 4!<br/><br/>In all seriousness, I created this site for my own personal use. So I made it work in Chrome. Right now, I don't have any immediate plans to test it in a myriad of other browsers and all their future updates.</dd>
